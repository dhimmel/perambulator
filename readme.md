# New Hampshire Boundaries

Who knew no one knew?

This project looks into the boundaries of New Hampshire towns.

Query for <https://overpass-turbo.eu/> to extract all town boundaries in New Hampshire.

```overpass
[out:json][timeout:180];

// Get the NH area to scope queries
area["boundary"="administrative"]["admin_level"="4"]["name"="New Hampshire"]->.nh;

/*
  Fetch ALL municipality relations (admin_level=8) in NH and include
  their member ways and nodes so the exporter can assemble true polygons.
  Note: Export → GeoJSON in Overpass Turbo to get full MultiPolygon geometry.
*/
rel(area.nh)["boundary"="administrative"]["admin_level"="8"]->.rels;
(.rels; >;);
out body;
```

## Usage

Parse the GeoJSON data:

```bash
uv run python 01_parse_boundaries.py
uv run python 02_compare_enfield_corners.py
```

This extracts 234 NH municipalities (admin_level=8 relations) from the raw Overpass data and outputs to `nh_municipalities.json`.

## Note to AI

Using uv for environment management, polars for dataframes, shapely for geometry. Python 3.14.
